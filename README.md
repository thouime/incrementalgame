## About the Project
This game combines Skyblock concepts, passive resource accumulation through Idling, and elements of incremental growth and automation, with a touch of collecting. The goal is to create a unique blend that doesn’t exist in one game yet.

Developing this project will allow me to practice programming and project management skills while building something I’ll enjoy.

## Features
- Expand your island by gathering materials.
- Explore other islands to upgrade your character and conquer the skies.
- Automate processes for resource gathering.
- Engage in incremental upgrades and world-building.
